# Deep_Learning_Internship_Work
Developed an Deep Learning based model for 15-minute interval electricity load forecasting at NIT Raipur.
During my Deep Learning Internship at the National Institute of Technology Raipur, I developed and evaluated deep learning models for high-resolution electricity load forecasting. Leveraging Dynamic Time Series techniques and LSTM-based architectures, I created a prediction model for 15-minute interval data specific to Chhattisgarh state. The project involved extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to enhance prediction accuracy and temporal consistency. The internship also deepened my understanding of real-world data challenges, model interpretability, and the application of deep learning in energy systems.
